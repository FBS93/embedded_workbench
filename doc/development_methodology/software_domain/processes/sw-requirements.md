# sw-requirements

## Purpose

Define software requirements from system requirements, system architecture and hardware-software interface.

## Input work products

- System requirements
- System architecture
- Hardware-software interface

## Output work products

- Software requirements

## Steps

1. Review the system requirements, system architecture, and hardware-software interface.
2. Identify the needs to be addressed by the software requirements.
3. Define the software requirements derived from the input work products.
4. Define traceability between software requirements and input work products.
5. Check the software requirements for completeness, consistency, and correctness.

## Guidelines

### Software requirements work product

The software requirements work product shall follow the [Requirements definition](../../resources/requirements_definition.md).

System requirements that do not include `sw` in their domain attribute and system architecture elements not traced to such requirements shall not be considered as input for software requirements definition.

#### Platform requirements

A dedicated `sw_platform.md` requirements document shall be defined to capture platform-related requirements.

Platform requirements shall define platform constraints derived from upstream elements.

Platform requirements shall have the following attributes:
- A unique identifier defined as a Markdown heading, following the pattern: `SW_PLATFORM_REQ_<X>`
  - The heading level may vary depending on the document structure.
  - `<X>` is a monotonically increasing number that shall never be reused.
- A description using the following pattern: `<subject> shall <required behavior>.`
  - `<subject>` identifies the element that is responsible for fulfilling the requirement.
  - `<required behavior>` may include actions, conditions, constraints, timing, or any other information needed to define the requirement clearly.
- Upstream traceability to one or more upstream elements. Shall be defined as a list of Markdown links referencing the corresponding upstream element.
- References to other requirements of the same engineering domain when applicable. Shall be defined as a list of Markdown links referencing the target requirement identifier.

The following platform requirement template shall be used:

```md
# SW_PLATFORM_REQ_<X>

<subject> shall <required behavior>.

Upstream traceability:
- [<UPSTREAM_ELEMENT_UNIQUE_ID>](#...)

References:
- [SW_...](#...)
```

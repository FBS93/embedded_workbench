# Embedded Fake Framework (EFF) overview

EFF is a lightweight, platform-agnostic fake functions framework designed to run on both embedded systems and host environments. Its purpose is to provide:
- Macro-based creation of fake functions for testing and validation.
- Fake functions autogeneration script.

The ECF framework provides CMake functions that encapsulate the usage of the autogeneration script. See [ECF cmake functions](../../tools/cmake/functions/ecf_mock.cmake)

This framework is a derivative work based on:
- fff (c) Meekrosoft.
- fff-mock-gen (c) Amcolex.

# Usage example

When the same fake shall be shared across translation units, declare it in one header and define it once in one source file:

```c
/* sensor_mocks.h */
#include "eff.h"

DECLARE_FAKE_VALUE_FUNC(int, sensor_read, uint8_t);
DECLARE_FAKE_VOID_FUNC(sensor_write, const uint8_t*, uint16_t);
```

```c
/* sensor_mocks.c */
#include "sensor_mocks.h"

DEFINE_EFF_GLOBALS;
DEFINE_FAKE_VALUE_FUNC(int, sensor_read, uint8_t);
DEFINE_FAKE_VOID_FUNC(sensor_write, const uint8_t*, uint16_t);
```

```c
/* test_sensor.c */
#include "sensor_mocks.h"

void example(void)
{
  int sensor_values[2U] = {10, 20};
  uint8_t command[2U] = {0xA5U, 0x5AU};

  RESET_FAKE(sensor_read);
  RESET_FAKE(sensor_write);
  EFF_RESET_HISTORY();

  SET_RETURN_SEQ(sensor_read, sensor_values, 2U);

  (void)sensor_read(1U);
  (void)sensor_read(1U);
  sensor_write(command, sizeof(command));

  (void)sensor_read_fake.call_count;
  (void)sensor_write_fake.arg1_val;
}
```

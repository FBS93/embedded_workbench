# KiCad state overview

This document describes the tool scripts located in tools/kicad_state/, which are listed below:
- `restore_kicad_state.py` restores `tools/kicad_state/state/<version>/` into the configured KiCad runtime paths. By default it restores only when the runtime is empty. Use `--force` to replace the current runtime.
- `save_kicad_state.py` captures the current KiCad runtime into `tools/kicad_state/state/<version>/`.
- `kicad_state_common.py` provides shared helpers for path resolution, version detection, directory replacement, and cleanup.

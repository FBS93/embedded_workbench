## Guidelines

### Software detailed design work product

Software detailed designs shall be derived from software architecture and software requirements.

Software requirements shall be used only as complementary input when the software architecture does not fully define the required behavior. 

Software detailed designs shall not define direct traceability to software requirements.

All software architecture elements shall be traced to one or more software units. Each software architecture element may be refined into one or more software units (1:1 or 1:N) depending on the software detailed design needs. 

In cases where a software component is refined into multiple software units (1:N), it is recommended to group the corresponding software units under a common folder named the same as the software component.

Software units shall be reused from existing libraries when available. Before creating a new software unit or implementing project-specific functionality within a software unit, it shall be verified whether the required functionality can be provided by [Embedded C Framework (ECF)](xxxyyy-ECF). If a specific implementation within a software unit is still required, it shall be assessed whether it can be fully or partially designed as reusable software for other projects, and therefore implemented in [Embedded C Framework (ECF)](xxxyyy-ECF). Project-specific software implementation shall be minimized.

Each project-specific software unit shall have its own software detailed design and shall consist of:
- A Markdown document named `<sw_unit_name>.md` following the template defined in [embedded_c_guidelines.md](../../../embedded_c_coding_guidelines/embedded_c_coding_guidelines.md#librarymodule-documentation) with the following additional information:
  - A unique identifier defined as a top Markdown heading (all other headings defined in the [embedded_c_guidelines.md](../../../embedded_c_coding_guidelines/embedded_c_coding_guidelines.md#librarymodule-documentation) template shall be shifted one level below this top heading), following the pattern: `SW_DETAILED_DESIGN_<X>`
    - `<X>` is a monotonically increasing number that shall never be reused.
  - The `<Library/module name> overview` chapter placeholder shall be replaced with the software unit name used in the document name using the following pattern `<Software unit name> overview`. The chapter shall contain the following information:
    - A description defining the software unit. The description shall include all necessary information to fully specify the software unit, written in a clear and concise manner.
      - The description shall document that all fault handling not explicitly defined by upstream elements shall be handled using a Design by Contract (DbC) approach with the [Embedded Assert Framework (EAF)](xxxyyy-EAF).
    - Upstream traceability to one or more software architecture elements. Shall be defined as a list of Markdown links referencing the corresponding software architecture elements.
    - A list of hardware resources used directly by the software unit, including their usage.
    - A list of external library dependencies, including their usage.
- One header file named `<sw_unit_name>.h` defining the main public header file of the software unit. Additional header files, if any, shall be named following the pattern `<sw_unit_name>_<header_specific_suffix>.h` and are intended to support the internal structure and detailed design of the software unit. All header files of the software unit shall follow the rules defined in [embedded_c_guidelines.md](../../../embedded_c_coding_guidelines/embedded_c_coding_guidelines.md).

The following additions to the Markdown document template shall be applied for generic software units, in addition to the template defined in [embedded_c_guidelines.md](../../../embedded_c_coding_guidelines/embedded_c_coding_guidelines.md#librarymodule-documentation):

```md
# SW_DETAILED_DESIGN_<X>

## <Software unit name> overview

<Description>.

All undefined fault handling cases shall be handled using a Design by Contract (DbC) approach with the Embedded Assert Framework (EAF) as follows:
  - An assert shall be triggered for any unexpected software condition (e.g., invalid states, unexpected values, unexpected execution paths, invalid function parameters, ...).
  - Upon assert trigger, the software shall enter an infinite loop with a critical section active to prevent further execution.

Upstream traceability:
- [<UPSTREAM_ELEMENT_UNIQUE_ID>](#...)

Hardware resources:
- <Hardware resource>: <Short description of its usage>

External dependencies:
- Embedded Assert Framework (EAF):  Provides assertions to enforce Design by Contract (DbC) in all undefined fault handling cases.
- <External library name>: <Short description of its usage>
```

#### Active object detailed design

If the software architecture specifies an event-driven model as a software design, all software components shall be refined 1:1 into software units implemented as active objects. A dedicated software unit named `events` shall be defined as header-only, containing all events defined in this software design, so that it is available to all active objects and can be used during implementation. This does not preclude the definition of other types of software units derived from other software architecture elements.

The software detailed design of software units implemented as active objects shall not duplicate information already defined in the corresponding software component. Instead, it shall extend it where needed and define upstream traceability to the corresponding software component.

The software detailed design of software units implemented as active objects shall be aligned with the capabilities and features of the [Event Driven Framework (EDF)](xxxyyy-EDF). As this framework will be used for their implementation, it shall be listed as a dependency in the software detailed design.

The overview chapter of the software detailed design Markdown document of software units implemented as active objects shall contain the following information in addition to the generic software units detailed design:
- The definition of the Hierarchical State Machine (HSM) with a state diagram using [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid).
  - The HSM definition shall be kept as simple as possible. It shall only extract event parameters and apply minimal logic to trigger specific functions (activities) based on the received event. Functional logic shall not be implemented directly in the HSM.
  - All activities and states defined in the state machine shall correspond to function names to be implemented. These function names shall follow the naming conventions defined in [embedded_c_guidelines.md](../../../embedded_c_coding_guidelines/embedded_c_coding_guidelines.md#naming-conventions).
  - Activities defined in the HSM shall be declared in a header file named `<sw_unit_name>_activities.h` to allow unit testing of these functions when required.

The following specialization of the overview chapter template shall be used for software units implemented as active objects:

```md
# SW_DETAILED_DESIGN_<X>

## <Software unit name> overview

<Description>.

All undefined fault handling cases shall be handled using a Design by Contract (DbC) approach with the Embedded Assert Framework (EAF) as follows:
  - An assert shall be triggered for any unexpected software condition (e.g., invalid states, unexpected values, unexpected execution paths, invalid function parameters, ...).
  - Upon assert trigger, the software shall enter an infinite loop with a critical section active to prevent further execution.

The following state diagram defines the Hierarchical State Machine (HSM) implemented by the active object:

Upstream traceability:
- [<UPSTREAM_ELEMENT_UNIQUE_ID>](#...)

Hardware resources:
- <Hardware resource>: <Short description of its usage>

External dependencies:
- Embedded Assert Framework (EAF): Provides assertions to enforce Design by Contract (DbC) in all undefined fault handling cases.
- Event Driven Framework (EDF): Provides an event-driven execution model based on active objects, HSMs, and a publish-subscribe mechanism.
- events: Provides the project-specific event definitions shared across all active objects.
- <External library name>: <Short description of its usage>
```

#### Platform package detailed design

If the software architecture specifies the platform as a software design, a software unit of type platform package shall be defined to implement all platform-reusable aspects. Project-dependent platform aspects of the platform software design shall not be implemented in the platform package and shall instead be implemented in project-specific software units with established traceability to them.

Platform package implementations shall be reused from [Embedded C Framework (ECF)](xxxyyy-ECF) when available. If not available, they shall be implemented as reusable software units within ECF rather than as project-specific software units.

As platform packages are not project-specific software units, their software detailed design shall be derived from the corresponding platform software design and upstream elements as a reusable and generic solution and shall not define project-specific traceability.

A platform package shall be identified by `<platform_name>`, which shall be a descriptive identifier reflecting the scope of the platform package (e.g., MCU family, board, execution environment, ...).

A software unit named `stdio` shall be defined within the platform package to implement [Embedded Base Framework (EBF)](xxxyyy linkar) stdin/stdout integration as specified in the platform software design.

The content structure of the platform package and the `stdio` software units deviates from the standard project-specific software unit structure. Their software detailed design shall consist only of the Markdown document based on the template defined in [embedded_c_guidelines.md](../../../embedded_c_coding_guidelines/embedded_c_coding_guidelines.md#librarymodule-documentation).

The [STM32F103C8Tx platform package](xxxyyy /stm32f103c8tx_platform_package.md) shall be used as a reference for platform package detailed designs.

# Byte FIFO test overview
This test verifies the functional behavior exposed by the public API of `emf_byte_fifo`.

# Use case
A byte-oriented circular FIFO stores variable-length streams while preserving FIFO order and supporting non-destructive reads by offset.

# Verification scope
The test validates externally observable behavior through the public API.
It covers ordering, free/used accounting, wrap-around behavior, offset peek, and state reset.

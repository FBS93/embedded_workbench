# Array FIFO test overview
This test verifies the functional behavior exposed by the public API of `emf_array_fifo`.

# Use case
A fixed-size circular FIFO stores and retrieves byte arrays while preserving FIFO semantics across normal operation and boundary conditions.

# Verification scope
The test validates externally observable behavior through the public API.
It covers ordering, full/empty transitions, and wrap-around behavior without relying on internal state.
